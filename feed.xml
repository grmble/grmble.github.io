But I've been thinking about a program aware training log
that runs on my phone for a while now.  So I had been
thinking about React Native and that possibility was in
the back of my mind.I was  not really aware of "Progressive Web Apps",
I only had a vague notion that webapps these days can
run offline too.  But I did read up on it and figured this
might be a viable option.  And I would
not have to deal with app stores.</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://grmble.github.io/posts-output/2022-10-28-learn-you-a-keeframe-part-3/</guid><link>https://grmble.github.io/posts-output/2022-10-28-learn-you-a-keeframe-part-3/</link><title>Learn You A Kee-Frame, Part 3</title><description>A wizard's staff has a knob on the end.-- TraditionalIt is time to write a more substantial example.
We are going to write a lifter's log, with records (haha!) of
weights lifted and fancy charts.  By pure chance I already
have such a thing and I love it, except for 2 deficiencies:
data entry sucks and it does not run on my phone.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://grmble.github.io/posts-output/2022-10-22-learn-you-a-keeframe-part-2/</guid><link>https://grmble.github.io/posts-output/2022-10-22-learn-you-a-keeframe-part-2/</link><title>Learn You A Kee-Frame, Part 2</title><description>Let's talk about The Elm Architecture for a bit.

This also implies
re-frame - I've read about it, there seemed to be a lot of boilerplate,
